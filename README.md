# Joy Prime in Nim

Joy Prime in Nim is a set of macros and runtime support that support
writing Nim application-level code in a functional, incrementally typed 
style inspired by Clojure. The goal is to provide simple, expressive,
low-ceremony idioms that allow application-level code to be more concise
and maintainable, at a modest cost to performance, but with easy access to 
Nim's full power and performance.
