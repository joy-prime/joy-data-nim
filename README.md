# Joy Prime in Nim

Joy Prime in Nim is a set of Nim macros and runtime support that enable a functional, incrementally typed 
Nim programming style with Clojure-inspired "modeling data as data". The goal is to allow most application-level
code to be written in simple, expressive Nim idioms, but with easy, natural access Nim's full power and performance.
